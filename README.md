## How to use
This is currently a temporary extension. So to use this extension, you must:
1. Clone or download this extenstion to your local machine. This extension should show as a folder on your machine.
2. In the Firefox browser, type "about:debugging" in the browser search bar.
3. Once on "about:debugging", on the left side of the page, click "This Firefox".
4. Once on "This Firefox", go under "Temporary Extensions" and click "Load Temporary Add-on...".
5. Now upload the "manifest.json" of the cloned/downloaded extension folder (what we did in step 1.)
